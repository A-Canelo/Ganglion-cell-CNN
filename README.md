# Ganglion-cell-CNN
For the sake of studying and practicing some Deep learning techniques, I have tried to reproduce the results from the paper:  
McIntosh LT, Maheswaranathan N, Nayebi A, Ganguli S, Baccus SA. “Deep Learning Models of the Retinal Response to Natural Scenes”. Adv Neural Inf Process Syst. 2016  
I used TensorFlow/Keras python library, which is very helpfull to code Deep learning-based neural networks. As training data I have used the file provided by the authors in https://github.com/baccuslab/pyret/raw/master/docs/tutorial-data.h5
